some guidelines
- choose a low carbon webhost (to explore: GreenGeeks, A2 Hosting, iPage, HostPapa, Acorn Host)
- using fewer JS widgets or none, reducing image/video, focus on a quick loading (test site speed)

Images
- optimise vector graphics and CSS effects with small files such as JPEG and GIF
- upload image at scale instead of relying on CSS auto resizing (not necesseray on WordPress as its uspport responsive images)
- compress
